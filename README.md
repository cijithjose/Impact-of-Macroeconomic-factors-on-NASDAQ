EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables on stock returns on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The research aims to identify the specific variables that have the greatest effect on stock prices and to understand the nature of the relationship between these variables and stock returns. Additionally, the study aims to examine how these variables interact with macroeconomic variables to influence stock prices. The research used a combination of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques to examine the relationship between macroeconomic and microeconomic variables and stock prices.

The literature review highlights the mixed findings of previous studies on the impact of macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, and exchange rate, on stock returns. The research questions focus on identifying the specific microeconomic variables that have the greatest effect on stock prices, including the impact of macroeconomic factors, trends in stock prices in relation to macroeconomic variables, the impact of unemployment, world oil prices, industrial production, Consumer price index, international trade, monetary and fiscal policy, national security and financial regulations, US government spending on Nasdaq stock exchange. The data has been collected for a time span of 20 years from January 2002 to November 2022 using a monthly data time series to portray a larger view of the relationship.
The study found that the distribution of all variables in the data was not normal and there were outliers present in all attributes, except for GDP, Consumer Price Index, Industrial Production Index, Oil Prices, and Trade Exports. The observed trend and pattern among these variables suggest that most of these outliers can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which America experienced a total shutdown.

An initial evaluation of a conceptual framework model was conducted to assess the effect of independent variables on a dependent variable using multivariate analysis techniques such as scatter plots and correlation analysis. The results indicated a strong positive correlation between the Nasdaq and various macroeconomic variables, including GDP, CPI, trade exports and imports, and a negative correlation with unemployment. The analysis suggests a correlation between macroeconomic variables and stock prices, with CPI, GDP, and trade exports and imports appearing to be the most influential factors on Nasdaq pricing. However, it should be noted that this model should not be relied upon without further statistical measures and significance testing.

To improve the accuracy of our dataset and mitigate the presence of high multicollinearity as identified through correlation analysis and the Bartlett test of sphericity, a dimension reduction technique was implemented. Specifically, Principal Component Analysis was conducted, which effectively grouped our variables into just three dimensions. Additionally, scaling and outlier treatment was applied to further enhance the precision of the results. The analysis revealed that economic growth, as represented by a composite variable comprising GDP, CPI, trade exports and imports, and the Industrial Production Index, emerged as the most significant factor influencing stock prices. The model demonstrated that for every unit increase in economic growth, there is a corresponding decrease of 0.281 units in stock prices, holding all other factors constant.
Model three did well under Linear regression using Ordinary Least Square method after removing the insignificant variables (derived using p-value at significance level of 0.05). This Model shows that there is higher impact of Unemployment rate on the stock price followed by Consumer price index and Industrial production index. The model demonstrated that for every unit increase in unemployment, there is a corresponding decrease of 376 units in stock prices, holding all other factors constant.
Hypothesis testing reflected that the variables such as Oil prices, National security, Trade policy, GDP, Tax are poor predictors of Nasdaq stock prices as the p value for all these variables was higher than alpha 0.05.

Other machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network was also used, and the models and hyperparameters were tuned to arrive at higher accuracy scores. GridSearchCv helped in identifying the best hyperparameters to be used. Random Forest regressor was chosen as the best model and the model predicted Consumer price index and GDP has the highest impact on Nasdaq stock prices followed by trade imports and unemployment rate.

The study recommends further research to confirm the validity of the model. It also suggests monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. Investigating the effect of other macroeconomic variables such as interest rate and inflation on stock prices, using the Random Forest Regressor model 1 for prediction and analysis of stock prices on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Considering Consumer Price Index, GDP, trade exports and imports, and unemployment rate when making investment decisions in the stock market while exploring other machine learning models and techniques to investigate the effect of other global and local factors on stock prices and evaluating the results in the context of different stock markets and economies around the world.


DISCUSSION


The discussion section of this study aims to interpret and analyse the findings in relation to the research questions and objectives. This section will also examine the findings in the context of the existing literature on the topic, and draw conclusions about the overall significance of the results. Overall, the discussion section will provide valuable insight into the factors that drive stock returns on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and inform investment decisions in the stock market.

•	CPI results is similar with Parmar, 2013; Venkatraja, 2014; Kumar, 2014; Asmy at el. 2010 and Adam 2008 i.e. when the CPI is rising, it typically indicates inflation, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services and higher profits for companies. This in turn can lead to an increase in stock prices, as investors anticipate that the company will continue to make a profit. However, if the inflation rate is too high, it can erode the purchasing power of consumers and make it difficult for companies to maintain profitability, leading to a decrease in stock prices. Hence it is stated that the Consumer Price Index has a positive and significant effect on stock returns for listed companies in our research.

•	When unemployment is high, consumer spending and economic growth tend to decrease, which can lead to lower profits for companies and a decrease in stock prices. Additionally, high unemployment can indicate a weaker economy, which can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a decrease in demand for stocks. Conversely,  low unemployment can indicate a strong economy, which can lead to an increase in investor confidence and an increase in demand for stocks. As stated previously  that the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on stock returns as scene in the linear regression model in this research.

•	The IPI is a measure of the change in the total inflation-adjusted value of output produced by manufacturers, mines, and utilities. When the IPI is declining, it typically indicates a decrease in industrial activity, which can lead to lower profits for companies and a decrease in stock prices which can lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a decrease in demand for stocks. Hence stated that the Industrial Production Index has a negative and significant effect on stock returns as observed through a linear regression model. The results are similar to (Patel, 2012).

•	Trade Exports & imports , Monetary & Fiscal Policy, Government Spending and Financial Regulations have a minor impact on stock returns and its statistically significant variables as seen in the regression model. Trade Imports and Fiscal policy have a positive relation meaning with one unit increase in these factors may lead to decrease in stock prices. On the other hand an increase in unit of Trade Exports, Monetary Policy, Government spending and financial regulations tends to decrease the stock prices as per the regression coefficient derived in LR model 3.



To conclude this study has practical implications for investors and policymakers in understanding the factors that drive stock returns on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and making informed investment decisions. However, the study has its own limitations, and it is important that this analysis should be considered in light of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. It is recommended to consider these findings alongside other factors and conduct further research to fully understand the relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices. In summary, this study provides a valuable contribution to the literature on the relationship between microeconomic variables and stock prices on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
